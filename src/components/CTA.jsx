              The development of web-based student enrolment information systems
              has been a significant research focus in improving the efficiency
              and effectiveness of education management. In the research
              literature, several studies highlight the RAD approach and its
              implementation in the development of student enrolment information
              systems, along with its challenges and benefits.
